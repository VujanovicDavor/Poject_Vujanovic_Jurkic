# Project Proposal

## Audience

In our project (shoe online shop) the audience will be most likely for the **youth**, because it will be easier to style
a page that is focused on them and so get more "*attention*" from the specific group.

## Project Summary

We are doing the project because we relly like the WEBT class and we can get a got mark on it.

Like already said we are doing a online shop for shoes i detail we will be doing:

+ Shoe selection
+ Shoping cart
+ Register, Login

This would be the main topics we wan't to focus on the whole project.

Right now at the moment the project has't go a name, isn't that important at the moment. It will focus on the shoes itself,
but accesories will be available too. 

For the project we will have the whole school year and will be prepared by me (Vujanovic Davor) and my friend (Jurkic Josip).
it may also take the whole shool year to finish it, beacuse we haven't got that much time and we need to do it also home,
so we can finish the things we have planed. 

Because it's a shool project there will be no costs for it.

We will be using the school pc and our own Lapotop if we have one. For the software we and my partner are using Visual Studio Code, GitHub and Moodle.

The following points we will need so we can start with the project

+ Software (will take 5 min to download and set it up)
+ The Shoe selection (will take 1 week or maybe even more to sync it with the database and to clean it up so it looks great.
+ Login/Register (maybe 3 Hours)
+ Shopping Cart(5 Hours maybe 1 day)

## Conclusion

Speaing in generall i think it's not going to be hard work but time consumeing, for exmaple the style of the site will take a lot of time because we may not like it anymore and so we have to change it, or the shoe selection will take also a time to make it as good and clearly as we can.
