# Project Proposal

## Audience

In our project (shoe online shop) the audience will be most likely for the **youth**, because it will be easier to style
a page that is focused on them and so get more "*attention*" from the specific group.

## Project Summary

We are doing the project because we relly like the WEBT class and we can get a got mark on it.

Like already said we are doing a online shop for shoes i detail we will be doing:

+ Shoe selection
+ Shoping cart
+ Register, Login

This would be the main topics we wan't to focus on the whole project.

Right now at the moment the project has't go a name, isn't that important at the moment. It will focus on the shoes itself,
but accesories will be available too. 

For the project we will have the whole school year and will be prepared by me (Vujanovic Davor) and my friend (Jurkic Josip).
it may also take the whole shool year to finish it, beacuse we haven't got that much time and we need to do it also home,
so we can finish the things we have planed. 

Because it's a shool project there will be no costs for it.

                                                    **Work in progress**
